Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms


Observation:
All devices successfully communicated through the switch.
After MAC address learning, the switch forwards frames only to the
destination port, improving efficiency and reducing unnecessary traffic.
No packet loss occurred.

Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms


Observation:
All devices communicated successfully through the hub.
However, unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts frames to all connected
devices for every transmission. This increases unnecessary traffic and
reduces overall network efficiency.
No packet loss occurred, but hub-based networks are less efficient
compared to switch-based networks.

Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms


Observation:
Devices successfully communicated across multiple switches.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) automatically blocked one redundant link
to prevent loops and broadcast storms.
The network remained stable and efficient with zero packet loss.

Reply from 192.168.10.243: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=128

Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 2ms, Average = 0ms


Observation:
After disconnecting one link in the ring topology, communication
continued successfully due to the alternate path.
STP recalculated the topology and activated the previously blocked port.
This demonstrates fault tolerance and higher reliability compared to
star topology.
No packet loss occurred.
